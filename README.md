# Additional Information
This was a senior project for our last semester at Ithaca College with professor Doug Turnbull. The purpose of the project was to create a web-app from scratch using Flask based on an original idea. The project features several routes, forms, and templates complete with CSS styles. All user and space data is kept in a SQLite database which gets updated in the background of the app. The OpenStreetMaps API was used to display the location of a certain space on its page.
